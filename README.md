# MathJax Editor Next

So this is basically a rewrite of MathJax Editor. This time, instead of using Tex, I'm using MathML.

Since I'm not parsing it like I did with Tex, it is pretty straightforward to implement a lot of stuff, since MathJax outputs a markup similar to MathML. The editor features now will be more restrict, but hopefully less buggy.
